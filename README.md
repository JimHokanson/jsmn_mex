This code is not stable and could crash Matlab. I will be adding in checks for poor JSON soon.

This code is meant to tokenize a JSON file, i.e. tell you where objects start and stop and how many elements they contain.

I had originally planned on writing a big benchmark repo that compared a bunch of different repos but I realized I really only liked 1 (maybe 2). These examples weren't perfect but they were a good starting point for this code.
